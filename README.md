### 🚀 About Me

I am currently immersed in an intensive, **project-based and peer-learning software development program at 42 Echol Kocaeli**. This unique methodology allows me to gain in-depth knowledge and hands-on experience in languages like C, C++, and Python, while focusing on algorithmic thinking, system programming, and data structures.

My passion for problem-solving and a continuous drive to learn push me to write clean, efficient, and scalable code. Complementing my studies at 42 Echol, I am also pursuing Computer Programming at Trakya University and Web Design & Coding at Istanbul University, which further strengthens my foundation in software development and helps me build a versatile skill set.

My goal is to create lasting solutions and contribute to innovative projects in the software world. I am always open to new challenges and learning opportunities.
